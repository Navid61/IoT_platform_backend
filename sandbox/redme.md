### `evaluateConditions` Function

This function is asynchronous because it involves database operations which are inherently asynchronous.

#### Parameters:

- `conditionsTable`: This is an array where each element can be:
    1. An array containing a single condition object: Represents an OR condition.
    2. An array containing multiple condition objects: Represents a group of AND conditions.

- `connection`: This is the RethinkDB connection object you use to interact with the database.

#### Inside the function:

1. `let results = [];`: We initialize an empty array where we'll store the results of evaluating each set of conditions.

2. The outer `for` loop (`for (const conditions of conditionsTable)`) iterates over each set of conditions in the `conditionsTable`.

3. **If the current `conditions` array has only one condition**:

    - `if (conditions.length === 1) { ... }`: This means we're dealing with an OR condition.
  
    - `const query = generateSingleReQLCondition(conditions[0]);`: We generate the RethinkDB query string for this single condition.

    - `results.push(await executeAndCheck(query, connection));`: We execute the query and check the result. The result (either `true` or `false`) is added to our `results` array.

4. **If the current `conditions` array has multiple conditions**:

    - This means we're dealing with a set of AND conditions.

    - `let andResults = [];`: We initialize an empty array to store the results of evaluating each individual AND condition.

    - The inner `for` loop (`for (const condition of conditions)`) iterates over each individual condition in the current set of AND conditions.

    - `const query = generateSingleReQLCondition(condition);`: For each condition, we generate the RethinkDB query string.

    - `andResults.push(await executeAndCheck(query, connection));`: We execute the query for each condition and check the result. Each result is added to the `andResults` array.

    - After evaluating all conditions in the current AND group, `results.push(!andResults.includes(false));` checks if any of the results in `andResults` is `false`. If even one is `false`, it means the entire group of AND conditions evaluates to `false`. If all are `true`, it means the entire group of AND conditions evaluates to `true`. The result for the entire group is then added to our `results` array.

5. After iterating over all sets of conditions in `conditionsTable`, the function returns the `results` array.
